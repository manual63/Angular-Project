# Angular-Project

### Welcome to the AngularJS Project!

This project is related to the [Quickly Setup AngularJS Project](http://www.shadholland.com/blog/quickly-setup-angularjs-project/) blog I posted. If you want to walk through the tutorial, please go read the blog. If you already have a good understanding of AngularJS, clone this repository and use it to get started and tweak as you need.

This branch is going to use Gulp to help us manage the AngularJS project.
